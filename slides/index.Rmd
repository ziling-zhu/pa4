For the [s] segments, **cog** is positively correlated to **skewness** (p < 0.05). The scatterplot (on page 13) suggests that the higher the skewness, the higher the center of gravity. Their relation is linear, and the assumptions this claim is under prove to be valid:
+ the mean of the residuals is (almost) zero;
